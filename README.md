# 🚀 Student Performance Prediction – Machine Learning Project  

## Introduction  
Welcome to my latest machine learning project! This model predicts **students' math performance scores** based on demographic and academic history. It serves as a valuable tool for **educators and institutions** to identify students who may need additional support.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The primary goal of this project is to develop a **predictive model** capable of forecasting students' math scores using features like previous academic performance and demographics.  

## 🔑 Key Features  
- **Data Ingestion:** Used Pandas for reading and preprocessing the dataset.  
- **Data Transformation:** Built a pipeline using Scikit-learn for:  
  - Handling missing values  
  - Scaling numerical features  
  - Encoding categorical variables  
- **Model Training:** Experimented with various regression models:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Gradient Boosting  
  - XGBoost  
  - CatBoost  
  - AdaBoost  
- **Model Evaluation:** Utilized **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning and evaluated using the **R² score**.  
- **Web Application:** Developed a **Flask-based web app** allowing users to input data and receive **predicted math scores** instantly.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, CatBoost, XGBoost, Flask  
- **Logging & Error Handling:** Custom logging and exception handling implemented for efficient debugging.  

## 🌍 Deployment Experience  
The model is deployed using cloud-based solutions:  
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** for seamless application deployment  
- **EC2 Instances & ECR** for containerized management  
- **Azure Containers & Images** for scaling strategies  

## 🚧 Challenges Faced  
- Ensuring **data quality** and handling missing values effectively.  
- **Fine-tuning** model parameters for optimal performance.  

## 🔮 Future Work  
- Enhancing the model with additional **features** and advanced algorithms.  
- Expanding deployment for **cloud accessibility** and real-world application.
